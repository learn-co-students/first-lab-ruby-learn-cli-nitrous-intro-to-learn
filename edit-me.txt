4. To pass this lab, either make any change to the content of `edit-me.txt` or create a new file.

You can open `edit-me.txt` and you'll see it is currently empty. Add anything to that file, save the file, and then run `learn`, everything should pass.

You can also pass this lab by creating a new file. From your console, you can run `touch new-file` to create a new file. If a new file is added to this lab, when you run `learn`, your tests should pass.
